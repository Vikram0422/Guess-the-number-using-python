# Guess the Number Game

This Python project challenges you to guess a randomly generated number between 0 and 100. Test your intuition and see how quickly you can guess the correct number!

## Features

- **Random Number Generation:**
  - The computer generates a random number between 0 and 100 for you to guess.

- **User Interaction:**
  - Input your guesses and receive feedback on whether the correct number is higher or lower.

- **Highscore Tracking:**
  - Your best score (lowest number of guesses) is tracked and compared to the previous highscore.

## Implementation

This game is implemented in Python, utilizing the `random` module for generating random numbers. The highscore is saved in a `hiscore.txt` file.
